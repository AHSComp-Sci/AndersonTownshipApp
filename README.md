# AndersonTownshipApp

Contributors: Matthew Xu, Caleb Myer, Jason Moore, Joe Brayshaw

We are students of Anderson High School who were given a mobile application project by the township.

End goal: To create an app using Adobe Phonegap/Cordova that is cross platform and functional on a wide range of mobile devices.
The app will contain a list of significant historical locations in Anderson Township with each containing images and embedded
Google Maps and streetviews.
